# Philosophers Problem

## Overview
This project simulates the Dining Philosophers problem using threads and mutexes in C. The Dining Philosophers problem is a classic synchronization problem in computer science, where multiple philosophers compete for shared resources (forks) without causing deadlock or starvation.


<!-- ## Parameters
The following parameters can be adjusted in the `main` function of the source code:
- `num_of_philosophers`: Number of philosophers.
- `time_to_die`: Time in milliseconds after which a philosopher dies if not eating.
- `time_to_eat`: Time in milliseconds a philosopher takes to eat.
- `time_to_sleep`: Time in milliseconds a philosopher takes to sleep.
- `num_of_times_each_philosopher_must_eat`: Number of times each philosopher must eat before exiting.

## Notes
- This implementation uses mutexes for synchronization.
- It's important to choose appropriate values for parameters to observe different scenarios and behaviors of the dining philosophers. -->
